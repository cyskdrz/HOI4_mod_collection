 inventorwar.8.d:0 "The two Teslas sat in the dining room, the elder holding a steak to his blackened eye. Across the table, his daughter stared him down, her coffee going cold. An airship shuffled past the window outside, “TESLA ELECTRICWORKS” scrawled along the side in stark black paint. Anywhere he looked, he could spy his name stamped proudly on appliances and cars and zeppelins. A sensation creeped up his back, half shame and half pride, disgust at the company that bore his name and delight to see it so pervasive. His daughter’s voice cut off the rumination.\n\n“Why are you here?”\n\nHe cocked his head. Zofia rolled her eyes.\n\n“I didn’t think you’d actually show up” she said, dim eyes glancing to the coffee cup. “She asked for you before she died, you know, even near the end. I had to tell her you were on business.”\n\nNikola set the steak down and let out a deep sigh. For what felt like an eternity he tried to find the words. A million theories and simulacrums, and he couldn’t think of what else to say to his daughter.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he croaked. “After what happened, I couldn’t bear being here. I-“\n\nZofia ran her hands over her face, her rage barely disguised as Tesla fumbled through an apology ten years too late. She brought a hand up to stop him.\n\n“Whatever this is, whatever you thought you’d accomplish-“\n\nHer father cut her off; a hand clenched.\n\n“I don’t think I have much time, Zofia, and I don’t have anywhere else to stay.”\n\nHe leaned forward, trying to come up with the words. Years of isolation had not helped his lackluster social skills.\n\n“Just- please. Give me a chance to make things right.”\n\nZofia sighed, rose from the table and poured her cold coffee down the drain. In the other room, Victor slept, still out of classes on bereavement. As much as she hated him, did he still deserve a chance to see his grandson? She didn’t know, but looking back at her father, she found it hard to truly hate him. He was a husk, not the monster she’d painted for so many years, just another absentee father."

 inventorwar.9.d:0 "Daylight rose over Saint Petersburg, flowing down the streets between the skyscrapers. Nikola watched it from the balcony, his breath hovering in the air ahead like smoke. Overhead, an airship passed, horn blaring. Yet again, his name was emblazoned on the side. Anywhere he looked, he saw his name plastered. Tesla light fixtures, Tesla airships, Tesla train cars, Tesla coffee makers, his last name repeated ad nauseum until it no longer felt like a name but some kind of mantra. Few men could comprehend living in history, but for Nikola, his name, his legacy was interwoven into the very wire that powered this country.\n\nZofia rapped her hand on the door of the balcony and his daydreams vanished. She was dressed formally, carrying a briefcase and a thermos.\n\n“I have to head into work early, can I trust you to keep an eye on Viktor for a few hours?”\n\nHis brow furrowed; she rolled her eyes.\n\n“If you’re going to stay here, the least you could do is spend some time with your grandson.”\n\nStepping back inside, Tesla loomed over the child in the living room. The space was already cramped, but between the three, it felt unimaginably small. The child sat in front of a Kinegram box, gormlessly watching some kind of cartoon, headphones strapped to where they smushed his unkempt hair. Zofia scoffed, shaking her head as the cartoons faded into an advertisement for some kind of “action doll”; A handful of them sat nearby in various states of disrepair.\n\n“Viktor,” she said, peeling the headset off. The child groaned quietly, grasping fruitlessly while Zofia gently turned his head.\n\n“Why don’t you spend some time with your grandfather?”\n\nViktor looked Nikola over, cheerful face now inscrutable. It was as if the child had taken stock, and he had found the man before him wanting. Nikola fumbled to the ground, legs popping as he sat. The two continued to sit, Zofia finally breaking the stalemate and heading for the door. As it latched shut behind her, Tesla grasped one of the dolls and looked it over. A soldier, Russian most likely, in some kind of armored knight suit.\n\n“So, uh-“ he croaked. “You like, em, dolls?”\n\nThe child sneered, crossing his arms in protest."

After a moment, the printer nearby whirred to life, spitting out a punched card. The image of a cat was stamped into the card, crude but unmistakable. Zofia smiled, showing the card to the gathered researchers.\n\n“And what animal did you think of?”\n\n“A cat, Ma’am.”\n\nA round of applause erupted; Zofia gave a small bow. A motion of the hand and a nearby projector clicked on, tape spooled up, and an image blazed up on the screen. A diagram of two men, and a tower between them. The researchers watched intently as she motioned to the screen.\n\n“As you have seen, the Consensus was able to detect the subject’s thoughts and transfer them on to a printed sheet. With the right direction, we can therefore acquire concrete subconscious data from a prompted subject.”\n\nThe projector clicked another slide into place; a group of people surrounding a tower.\n\n“The Tesla towers throughout the nation can be retrofitted with these receivers, allowing us to acquire data on the thoughts of the nation, all with a simple implant.”\n\nAnother click, another slide, this time a set of towers across Russia.\n\n“This is where the Commonality Consensus comes in. Imagine a nation unbound by the need for elected officials, instead guided by the shared mental consensus of millions. Instead of lawmakers debating endless hours, a simple ping to the network and a million minds can supply their vote with a thought.”\n\nZofia flicked the projector off and stepped in front of the screen. With a smile, she held up the mass of electrodes and wires."

They’d planned on demonstrating next week, but with the Board of Directors in town early, she needed to seize the chance. The applause was a good sign, but what she needed was capital, more test subjects, a greater benefactor than her personal bank account. There was the company stipend, but she refused to touch it. Taking a handout from her absentee father’s company was a line she was, at least for now, unwilling to cross.\n\nThe unspoken presence of another drew her attention away from her thoughts. A man sat across from her in the lab, just barely out of sight. Her eyes fell on him and he rose, stepping out into the scant sunlight that shone through the windows above. A beady little man in a suit with a terrible combover.\n\n“Tesla,” he said, making only the slightest effort to disguise his distaste. Zofia’s nails dug into her desk.\n\n“What forced you out of your hole this time, Lysenko?”\n\nHe chuckled quietly.\n\n“I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about,” he strolled over to the desk, lifting the electrode cap and turning it over in his hands. Zofia watched him closely with a mix of disgust and fear. A part of her wanted to slap him, snatch it from his hands and drive him out of her lab. Another, more rational part knew she couldn’t, even with her last name she couldn’t get away with antagonizing Russia’s favorite freakshow director. Lysenko set the cap down and gave her a smile that could have eaten all the shit on Earth.\n\n“-and I’m not terribly impressed.”\n\nTesla leaned back, the creak of the office chair echoing through the lab like a gunshot. Lysenko’s beady eyes remained locked on hers, that stupid smile still scrawled across his face.\n\n“Well, when I get into the business of disfiguring animals, I’ll be sure to give you a call.”\n\nThe smile faded, Lysenko leaned forward, both hands on the desk.\n\n“You got funding for your little brain project because of your name, girl, but the Kremlin won’t fund these fantasy projects of yours.”\n\n“No, they fund your little fantasy projects,” she spat back, rising from the desk.\n\n“You might be able to impress the Tsar with your monster parlor tricks, sticking lungs and hearts into people, but what I can offer them is real, tangible changes.”\n\n“I make them better humans. What you’re offering them”, Lysenko sneered, “is to build a machine to make themselves redundant.”\n\nHe leaned back off the desk, headed for the door.\n\n“You want to make a machine to replace the government, and what after that Perhaps a machine to replace all of us? Subsume flesh to steel?”"

 inventorwar.12.d:0 "An island of green in a sea of metal, the arboretum was encased in a thin plastic shell, adorned with fanned ventilators. The smog of the city flowed around it, held back by clogged filters. Nikola watched from a cheap metal bench as pigeons moved across the plasticine roof. He remembered when finding a park in Petersburg was as simple as walking down the street; now, he had to cross the complex and ride an elevator just to find this little slice of life.\n\nThe boy sat next to him, kicking his feet impatiently at the grass. Tesla, however, found himself increasingly lost in thought. When he first moved to Russia, the immensity of nature was manifest wherever he looked. Vast forests of aspens and pines stretched as far as the horizon in some places. He glanced down at a bed of flowers, planted upon hydroponic beds and organized neatly by type. In the forest, wildflowers grew and intermingled into a menagerie of color. Here, there could be no such disorganization. Man had planted his flag over nature and found its’ disharmony unacceptable.\n\n“Can we go now?”\n\nViktor’s voice broke the silence, snapping Tesla from his thoughts. He looked down at him, befuddled.\n\n“Go? We just got here.”\n\n“I can see trees on the screen whenever I want.”\n\nTesla cocked his head; a flock of pigeons scattered overhead as a passenger zeppelin blazed past. \n\n“Have you ever been out of the city?”\n\n“Sometimes we go to other cities.”\n\nThe old man sighed, looking away from the boy and back to the miniature forest that surrounded them. How long would a place like this last before it would be torn down to build more apartments? How long before there were no more places like this here, no more places like this anywhere? How long before a generation was raised entirely beneath a steel sky, concrete trees, rust and dust?\n\nOnce more, Viktor pulled him from his thoughts. The boy rose to his feet and tugged on Tesla’s jacket, motioning back towards the airlock.\n\n“We’re gonna miss my shows.”\n\nTesla rose from the bench, taking one more glance of the arboretum, then back at Viktor before they departed."

The ubiquitous streetlamps were swallowed in an ocean of black. Figures moved below, occasionally glancing up at him with faces he couldn’t make out. From behind, a familiar voice rose, young and filled with the vigor of a man without mistakes.\n\n“You failed them,” the voice said. Each syllable dripped with venom; words more snarled rather than spoken. “Three billion people, trillions of years, all to culminate in you, and you failed them.”\n\nA younger Tesla stood before him, indistinct. The Older Tesla found his eyes became fuzzy when he tried to look at the Younger, as though the memory rejected perception. It stepped forward, footsteps silent against the hardwood as it spoke.\n\n“The power to change the world and you deferred it, handed it off to kings and emperors, moneychangers, monsters.”\n\nThey were standing in a trench now, the stench of death and human waste conquering the senses like an invading army. He could feel vomit rising. The younger motioned around; mountains of corpses laid about, the sounds of battle somehow both deafening and distant. Somewhere, a man screamed for his mother while a bullet settled in his torn open belly.\n\n“This is your legacy, our legacy,” the Younger Tesla said. “In how many homes would an empty armchair be occupied, how many graves would be empty, if you had just stopped?”\n\nThe Younger Tesla pointed a blurred finger, face swirling and distorting into a maelstrom of features that defied description.\n\n“This is the world you crafted, the world we made, when we handed the Steele of Daedalus to a tinpot Tsar.”\n\nIt was impossible to tell, but he almost sensed a wicked smile in the swirling din of his younger self’s face.\n\n“And Zofia will make the same mistake you did.”\n\nTesla rose with a cry, the couch and sheets soaked in sweat. His throbbing head fell into his hands while the sound of the radiator kicking on masked his sobbing."

Messy hair, eyes reddened and baggy, he looked half dead. The door behind him creaked as he stepped into the living room; Viktor and Zofia were already crowded around the kinescreen. Viktor, clearly bored, regarded the inventor with a disinterested stare. Zofia, on the other hand, rose to her feet as he entered.\n\n“The Tsar has been shot.”\n\nThe sentence took time to worm its’ way through the aging Tesla’s neurons. The Tsar? Alexander? No, no, it was Michael now wasn’t it? His befuddled expression was broken by the distant call of police sirens. Somewhere, not too close but not too far away, an explosion rang out. Zofia ran to the window, flicking the automated shutter switch. They hummed into place, shrouding the room in darkness as the three returned their attention to the kinescreen. The news broadcast had been replaced with an emergency tone. A white Russian eagle dominated the screen as a monotone voice read out instructions; it was difficult to tell if the voice was simulated or human.\n\n“Remain indoors, a curfew of 1800 hours is now in effect for Saint Petersburg. Groups of individuals greater than three are not to congregate outdoors until an all clear has been issued. An official statement from the acting Prime Minister will be issued shortly.”\n\nOutside, the sounds of piston-powered mechanica filled the air.

Mind you, to Tesla everything beyond the walls of his self-imposed exile was remarkable. Sleep was still uneasy, he flopped in bed, thrashing and sweating until forced to awaken at some ungodly hour. Tonight was no different; Tesla emerged from his room to find Zofia on the balcony, a lit cigarette in hand.\n\n“Trouble sleeping?”\n\nShe shot him an ugly expression, barely masking hatred. Tesla had long since grown tired of the theatrics, but she had offered him a place to stay when he’d done everything to draw her ire. Tesla joined her at the balcony, leaning on the cold metal rail. The sounds of the night enveloped the two, the smell of exhaust from the factory district, the heavy thumping of rail cars above.\n\nZofia finally cut the silence.\n\n“I wondered if I’d see you again. Spent years thinking about what I’d say.”\n\nShe took a long drag, then blew, letting the smoke curl in the air.\n\n“Now that you’re here all I can think to ask is why?

When I made weapons, I made them with the belief they’d deter wars. When the weapons I’d designed were turned on human beings, I was too deep in that river to turn back.”\n\nHollow eyes looked out across the Saint Petersburg skyline. The tower living complexes, the vast industrial district, the twinkling lights of the financial zone. The airships buzzed overhead, and to the West the Baltic lapped at the corrugated steel coast. All of this, down to the most minute detail, owed him for its existence in some small detail. To Tesla, all that credit wasn’t just meaningless, it was a curse. He carried on, letting the cool sprawl air wash over him.\n\n“I don’t expect you to forgive me for running. I felt like I had to leave everything behind, put myself somewhere I could never hurt anyone again. The life I’d built with you, your mother, it was a sham. All of it built on the charred bodies of the people who I’d helped kill.”\n\nHe turned to his daughter; she watched him pensively, indecision painted on her features. Zofia looked down, briefly deep in thought.\n\n“I can’t forgive you”, she said, “I spent so many years hating you and-“\n\nHer breath caught, she took another drag, tears welling in her eyes.\n\n\“We needed you, and you just left us.

Regrets were his only real company now, aside from his daughter, and she couldn’t bear to look at him while Lilya was interred.\n\nTesla thought back to the night they met, a Winter ball in Riga. He felt like a complete outsider at a party that was essentially for him. The electrification of Moscow had been a rousing success, and so the Tsar had called for celebration. The Baltics were next up, and of course Riga would be a new model city. They’d met outside, he’d needed a chance to breathe, to get a break from shaking hands and supposedly grateful smiles.\n\nNow, none of that really mattered."

Papers and buckets of electronic parts were scattered about.\n\n“A project,” she said, setting her pen down.\n\n“Might I ask what?”\n\n“I call it the Commonality. It’s a brain interface network, pulls information from the mind and formats it as useable data.”\n\nTesla picked up the prototype, adjusting the straps and diodes. Zofia sighed, unamused.\n\n“Was there something you needed?\n\n”Tesla was still wrapped up in looking at the device, her comment broke him out of his fascination.\n\n“Would you like help? I know you wanted me gone but perhaps I could make myself useful?”\n\nThe old man smiled, earnestly, for the first time in years. Zofia raised an eyebrow, glancing back over the endless paperwork and machinery. With another sigh, she shifted her chair over and motioned for her father to take a seat. Tesla eagerly sat; he was just happy to be back in a workshop again. Zofia’s was not unlike his own back in Budapest, decades prior, but without the baggage of the past.

Zofia had, begrudgingly, allowed her father to see her proper laboratory. It wasn’t that dissimilar to Teslagrad, the only thing missing was the arid desert air and the smell of cabbage. He leaned over a small glass container; a pair of mice ran back and forth within, taking breaks to sip water or eat. They hardly seemed to notice the tiny blinking diodes protruding from their heads. One of the diodes blinked three times, prompting a teletype machine nearby to begin spitting out paper. A lengthy report slowly took form, regions of the brain highlighted and notated with descriptions of activity.\n\nThe door to the lab opened, the report slipping from Tesla’s hands to the floor. A stocky man in a heavy coat stepped inside, peeling a facemask away to reveal a freshly shaved, angular face. An odd pin was attached to the jacket, an owl contained in an atom. Zofia regarded the man, he responded in kind and reached into his jacket to withdraw a small metallic box. She took it under her arm, sauntering over to the desk while the man secured his face mask. Tesla cocked his head, the messenger noting his curiosity with a simple shrug.\n\n“Smog in the air, can’t be too careful these days.”\n\nAnd with that the messenger vanished out the door.\n\nZofia slid the box over the counter, pressing a button on the side with a satisfying click. An indentation became visible with an almost imperceptible needle. She took a deep breath, then pressed her thumb down on the needle. A second later she pulled it away as the metal box let out a subdued “beep” and opened fully.\n\nStepping towards the desk, Tesla glanced down at the documents within. The same symbol, the same owl stamped over and over on pages and pages of research. One name stood out, and after a moment he finally screwed up the courage to ask."

They’ll tell you you’re making the world better, and in the same breath they’ll turn it on people. You’ll be there, you’ll have blood onyour hands, blood so thick you can never wash it away, blood-“\n\nZofia raised her hand, snatching the diode cap out of her father’s grip.\n\n“You think you can lecture me?”\n\nShe wagged a finger in his face.\n\n“You knew exactly what you were doing. You built a gun and then bemoaned the world for using it. You buried yourself in a desert, left all of us behind so you could wallow away until you killed yourself or dropped dead. You want to lecture me on morality?”"

 inventorwar.22.d:0 "这座以她家族姓氏命名的高塔如巨石般耸立在圣彼得堡上空。塔身布满信号灯与电缆，机械作业队悬吊在平台外晃荡。佐菲娅与零区的科学家审阅着图纸，标记着发射器的安装位置——将特斯拉塔改造为中继站本是个简单的方案。地面工作人员只需要制定计划就好，而那些攀爬在脚手架上实施方案的工人考虑的可就多了。\n\n下方街道上，尼古拉·特斯拉穿行于城市间，偶尔抬眼望向天际线。工厂群塔楼排出的闷热废气裹挟着波罗的海的冷风，他步履沉重地走过工业区，回到居住穹顶群。这些粗野主义建筑群闪烁着百万灯火，恰似被浓烟遮蔽的、不可见的星空。\n\n他回不了电磁城，也回不到佐菲娅身边。再次孤身一人，除了蔽体衣衫与满心悔恨，别无长物。精疲力竭的特斯拉跌坐在长椅上，面前是封闭植物园的钢化玻璃窗。桦树与松树在划定区域内生长，挂着标识牌，围着防护栏。"

 inventorwar.23.t:0 "日记"
 inventorwar.23.d:0 "The flat felt cold, even emptier than it had before her father had returned. Zofia sat at the dining room table, running her thumb along a cup of synthetic coffee. Even with sugar, the stuff was horridly bitter. Even with her salary, she couldn’t afford the real thing. Just before bringing it to her lips, her eyes fell on a pack near the door. It was unassuming, military-issue perhaps, but it wasn’t hers.\n\nIt was her father’s satchel. He must have forgotten it after their fight.\n\nWith some trepidation, she stepped over and swung open the flap on the top, finding some odds and ends. A tin of cabbage, a tin of milk, a stuffed pigeon, and a leather-bound journal. The latter caught her attention especially, and she retrieved it.\n\nLaying it out across the table, Zofia thumbed through the pages. Her father’s thoughts, sketches, blueprints, laid out through the decades. A few entries about the Tsar, about Teslagrad, about the company and the war. Nearest the middle, something slipped out and clattered on to the table.\n\nA photo, faded and yellowed, of her mother and father on their wedding day.\n\nShe sighed, turning her attention back to the journal. There was a section that had been folded over and tucked into the lining. With a slight tug, she pulled it loose and unfurled a ripped set of notes. They were scatterbrained, as if written in the midst of a panic attack, scratched or perhaps more accurately carved into the paper with the frantic scrawl of the deranged.\n\nOne paper drew her attention, sketches of scenes and icons she couldn’t quite understand. A cog and torch flag flying over Big Ben, a cloud shaped like a mushroom enveloping a city, a hammer and sickle behind what looked like a bearded elderly man in glasses. Amongst all of it, scrawling of the word “ruin” over and over again. On one page, a photo was taped, showing a man in an odd looking uniform standing in front of a crowd. He was flanked by strange red flags and torches and an army of soldiers in black uniforms. What was truly odd, though, was a writing penciled on to the photograph.\n\n“January 11th, 1962.”"

 inventorwar.24.d:0 "Predictably, the knock at the door came sometime around noon, just as Zofia was finishing making lunch. Her father stood in the doorway once more, lightly dusted in snow and shivering.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he mumbled. “I forgot my things, I won’t be but a moment.”\n\nZofia sighed, gesturing for him to come in as she returned to the kitchen. A pot of stew on the counter boiled under her watch as she called out to the dining room.\n\n“I have to apologize myself, actually. I took a look through your things while you were out.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if you’d come back,” she continued.\n\nTesla stepped into the kitchen, satchel over his shoulder and journal in his hand. He leafed through the leatherbound book before glancing back at his daughter, suddenly very pale.\n\n“You read- You saw all of that, didn’t you?”\n\n“Yes, I was curious actually, what were all those sketches?”\n\nHe closed the journal, stuffing it back into his bag. He was even paler, a thin sheen of sweat beginning to manifest on his brow. He felt suddenly lightheaded, tripping over his words.\n\n“J-Just some old traveling notes. N-Nothing to-“\n\nPain. His chest erupted in pain. In an instant he collapsed to the floor, gasping for air. Zofia rushed over, panic and confusion on her face as her father convulsed. Viktor emerged from his room, glancing aside to see his mother trying desperately to revive his grandfather. Stock-still, he could only watch in terror as Zofia rushed off to call for a doctor."

It was a scene Zofia was uncomfortably familiar with. He laid there, staring at nothing in particular while medications flowed through his veins.\n\nThe doctors told her it was a massive heart attack; frankly he was lucky to be alive at all, but the prognosis was poor at best. Even if they had an available transplant, the aging man was hardly an ideal candidate. Thus, the architect of the world found himself at long last making acquaintance with the reaper.\n\nZofia sat, Viktor in lap, and stared out the window. From afar, she could see the Tesla tower being completed in the distance. They were close to activation, but naturally she had stepped away from the project momentarily."

 inventorwar.26.d:0 "“Naturally, some modifications had to be made to the system. Orders from above, you understand.”\n\nZofia glanced over the new specifications. The implants had been modified, but in a way that wasn’t entirely clear. It was all buried under mountains and mountains of verbiage. Deliberate obfuscation, that much was clear. She sighed in annoyance, looking up at the Security Officer.\n\n“I understand, but we can’t improvise implants for millions of people. Next time your superiors make changes, I need to be made aware.”\n\n“Of course, of course.”The officer walked off, leaving Zofia to try and piece together exactly what had been changed. She didn’t trust the new project managers, and she trusted the new government even less. Their patronage had been more than forthcoming, but it was clear they had something they wanted to get out of this beyond just altruism.\n\nShe never noticed the slight adjustment to the neurological matrix, almost imperceptible even to its’ designer. Just enough adjustment to allow a counter-frequency to be transmitted and received by the brain.\n\n Just enough to make a nudge to the psyche, barely even noticeable to the user."

 inventorwar.27.d:0 "A few days passed before her father could speak again, though it was seemingly only rasps and croaks. His senses had somewhat returned, but only enough to glance at her occasionally. For the first time, perhaps in her whole life, she felt pity for her father. She’d built him up for so long as the villain, the great architect of her sorrow, but now, at the end of the road all she saw was a man. Not a monolith, not a monster, but a fragile old man dying in a hospital bed.\n\n“I’m- I’m sorry”, he croaked out. Zofia perked up, leaning in close.\n\n“For what?”\n\n“For everything, I should have been there for the two of you. I wasn’t.”\n\nHe reached out, grasping her wrist.\n\n“Everything I did, I did for you, for your mother. For the world. I just wanted to make things better.”[get_reconciliation_text_1]"

 inventorwar.28.d:0 "Zofia was never good with the press. Mind you, she’d avoided them most of her life, but even then being the daughter of Nikola Tesla meant a certain level of journalistic interest, however minor. The crowd assembled around the Tesla Tower compound, implants blinking behind their ears, ready to see the future of the Russian Empire.\n\nBefore her was a lever, simple and relatively unassuming. In any other context, pulling it would be inconsequential. Here, however, this was the lever of fate. Throwing it would usher in a new paradigm, activating the Commonality and linking the entire consensus of the nation. Millions of minds, united in common cause for democracy.\n\n “Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.”\n\nShe glanced back at the scientist, who gave her a knowing look. With a deep breath, she reached out, gripped the metal switch and threw it down.\n\nIn an instant, the whole of the tower erupted in blue light. Ticker tape recorders began rattling off sheets of punch-card data. A great sigh blew through the crowd as their implants connected with the relay.\n\nOne by one, a great wave swept the whole of Eurasia as each tower threw their own switch. A wave of progress carried from the Baltic to the Black Sea to the Siberian wilds. Zofia felt her own implant kick on, a slight warmth manifested behind her right ear, just beneath the skin.\n\nNearby, a kinegram monitor snapped to life. Amber hue bathing the room like a polluted sunset. A single word appeared on screen.\n\n"

 inventorwar.29.d:0 "From the hospital bed, Nikola Tesla watched the tower erupt in light. An enormous beacon, stretching into the clouded sky. A nurse stepped in, set a tray of food down near his bed, and headed for the door. Behind her ear, Tesla spotted a tiny blinking light. The woman paused, silhouetted in the electric glow of the hallway.\n\n“You should be proud, Mr. Tesla.”\n\nHe stared at the dinner tray, eyes glued to the synthetic meat and off-color onions. Leaning forward, he nudged the food around with a fork. The nurse sighed, then walked off to continue passing out trays.\n\nA moment later, the light was blocked by another woman. The fork dropped from his hand and clattered to the ground. A woman in a white dress was standing there.\n\nHis wife.\n\nLilya smiled and stepped across the room towards him; she moved as if in water, as if gliding through an unseen membrane. The movements were both fast and slow at the same time. Everything about her was paradoxical. In an instant, she was at his bedside. In a hundred thousand hours, she was at his bedside. A few seconds stretched into the infinite.\n\nShe sat down, a deathly cold hand grasped his. Lilya’s smile waned as she ran a hand over his pallid face.\n\n“You know,” she said, “I wanted Zofia to be an artist.”\n\nThe two shared a quiet, somber laugh.\n\n“I’m sorry, I should have-“\n\nLilya shook her head."

 inventorwar.30.d:0 "Again, Zofia watched a parent be interred to the Earth. A thick mix of snow and industrial material sprinkled from the sky above as the last dirt covered Nikola Tesla’s grave. A fog descended over Saint Petersburg, wind kicking up off the coast. Zofia pulled the collar of her black coat up and shuddered against the frigid breeze. The service itself was small, relatively speaking. After the fact, nearly a hundred people filed through to pay their respects. Scientists, entrepreneurs, a handful of Teslaworks executives, the expected crowd.\n\nOne man broke off from the group, however, and approached her. A portly fellow in a long coat and suit, an ushanka fit only for a tourist covering his withered head. He reached out with a pair of oversized mitts; a sullen smile across his face.\n\n“Miss Tesla, is it?”\n\nZofia shook his hand, puzzled.\n\n“I don’t believe we’ve met, Mr?”\n\n“Edison, Charles Edison.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. He laughed.\n\n“I know, your father hated mine. That’s why I came out all this way, express my condolences. Bury the hatchet.”\n\nCharles glanced down at the grave. It was modest, just a simple epitaph and a name. He turned his attentions back to Zofia, who continued to eye him suspiciously. Edison wiped the industrial snow off his face, coughing as he did.\n\n“You ask me, if my pop had just paid yours what he owned, this whole bloody rivalry could’ve been avoided.”\n\nEdison sauntered off, calling back to her as he headed towards his car.\n\n“You ever get tired of the snow, give me a call.

 inventorwar.31.d:0 "The city was in utter chaos. Germans and British fought running battles through the Saint Petersburg streets. The winter palace was besieged by an army of anarchists, the city center was in flames.\n\nAbove it all was the Tesla Relay Tower, and within sat Zofia Tesla. The British technicians fussed over the machinery, picking and prodding at it while she sat handcuffed to a pipe. One of the officers marched in, barking orders at the soldiers.\n\n“Well, what are you all waiting for? Shut this thing down!”\n\nZofia screamed, pulling at her restraints.\n\n“Wait! You don’t understand! This isn’t a communications tower! If you shut the relay down-“\n\nA soldier cracked her across the face with the back of his hand. She tasted blood and through blurred vision, watched in horror as the officer marched over to the console. In a fluid motion, he grasped the override lever and slammed it into the off position.\n\nIn an instant, Zofia’s mind felt as if it were on fire. She screamed, along with everyone else in the complex. Across Saint Petersburg, millions of Russians who weren’t already dead or dying dropped where they stood. Without the tower to manage the implants, thoughts flushed through the minds of everyone in the city, to the point that it was difficult to tell whose thoughts were whose.\n\nSoldiers turned their weapons on each other or themselves, within thirty minutes thousands had taken their own lives to escape the deafening cacophony of uncontrolled thought. The British and German soldiers could only watch, helplessly, as an entire city descended into madness.\n\nZofia, for her part, used her free arm to drive her nails into the skin behind her ear. With a hefty pull, she ripped the neural implant from her head and tossed it to the ground. She writhed on the floor, seizing and thrashing as the soldiers attempted to restrain her further. In a matter of moments, she was dead, body twisted into a warped facsimile of a human.\n\nWith the central relay down, the rest soon followed. A wave of inconceivable madness swept the entirety of Eurasia, sparing only those luddites who had avoided the implants."

Zofia looked towards the window, watching a fleet of zeppelins pass by.\n\n“I spent so many years thinking about what I’d say to you. How much you hurt us, hurt mother. You were never there. My entire life, I spent expecting one day to see you, and when we finally meet you’re one foot in the grave.”\n\nA morbid chuckle escaped her lips. Her father’s eyes watched her; tired, dull eyes that had seen far too much for one man. She looked down at nothing in particular, thoughts plunging into the fetid wound her father had left in her soul. Finally, nearest the bottom of all the heartache, was one last mote of something. Love, maybe? No, something different.\n\n“I forgive you. I shouldn’t, but-“ she choked on her words.\n\n“Since we’re here, taking account of things. I forgive you. I can’t let you go thinking I hated you. I can’t bring myself to do that to you.”"
